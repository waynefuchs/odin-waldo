## Progress

I have realized that I need to work on design patterns more. I need to understand state management better. I need to eliminate anti-patterns from this code base.

I have created a new branch as a testbed for some of these concepts, but it does not count towards my github streak. I think it will count in the future _if_ I merge those changes in. But I don't want to take that chance. So I'm writing this here.
